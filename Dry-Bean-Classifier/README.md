## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system (preferably Python 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook installed (you can install it via pip: `pip install notebook`)

## Installation

1. Extract the zip file

2. Place the dataset file (`Dry_Bean_Dataset.csv`) in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.


## Running the Notebook

1. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. This will open a web browser displaying the Jupyter Notebook dashboard. 
   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
   - Click on the notebook file (`Dry_bean_classifier.ipynb`) to open it.

3. Run the notebook cell by cell to execute the code.
   - To run a cell, click on it and press `Shift + Enter`.
   - Alternatively, you can use the `Run` button in the toolbar.

4. Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook for each section.

## Note

- Make sure to run the cells sequentially as some cells may depend on the output of previous cells.
- Take note of any errors or warnings that may occur during execution and troubleshoot accordingly.
